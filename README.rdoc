= Ruby Transform

== Introduction

Provides a series of s-expression transformations useful for automatic refactoring or morphing of Ruby/Rails/Sinatra code.

== Example

This is just one of many examples:

= Block Method To Proc Transform
Looks for cases where we're calling a single method on a single-parameter block argument.
These instances can use the Ruby 1.9 and ActiveSupport "Symbol#to_proc" trick.

Example:

  collection.map {|d| d.name }

Transforms To:
  
  collect.map(&:name)
